# Payments integration summary

> Not fully implemented: home donations and store plans are still in development.

## Problem identified

Users could attempt to pay without being authenticated → the UID was lost for subscription attribution.

## Current code state

Legacy components **`PricingPlans`** and **`PaymentModal`** (under `shared/organisms/`) were **removed** during the
architecture refactor.

### Active flows

| Area                | Location                                              | Notes                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Donations           | `src/features/home/components/DonationSection/`       | Simulated form on the landing page               |
| Plans / shop        | `src/features/store/` + `src/services/store/`         | `SubscriptionPlanService`, `PlanScheduleService` |
| Session and plan UI | `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`, Redux `uiSession`      | Selected plan and demo mode                      |
| Persistence         | `@/services/persistence`, Supabase `user_plans` table | Per `API_CONFIG.MODE`                            |

### Plan identifiers

UI plans use ids such as `free`, `premium`, `pro` (see `src/store/types/uiPlan.ts` and `src/services/store/`).
